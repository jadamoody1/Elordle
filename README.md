<h1>Elordle</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project implements a framework for a computer-aided one-player game interface, alongside two games: Snowman and Elordle. The OnePlayerGame interface defines essential methods for game operations, while the specific game classes implement these methods according to their unique rules and mechanics. The Snowman game is inspired by the classic game Hangman, where a player guesses letters in a hidden word. The Elordle game is inspiried by the classic game Wordle, where a player tries to guess the choosen word.
